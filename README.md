To that colour scheme, there was added Medium Turquoise colour (#38D2D2) for the buttons with 3d effect from the website [Beautiful CSS buttons examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples).
The same colour was used for the gradient effect on the navbar, with the help of [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) web app.

#### Typography

Fonts used on the website are from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), namely **Carter One** and **Oxygen**. Carter One appears in the Logo, whilst Oxygen in the rest of the website.
