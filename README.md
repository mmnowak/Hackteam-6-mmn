#### Strategy

- **Roles:**

  - New users
  - Current users

- **Demographic:**

  - All ages
  - ...

- **Psychographic:**
  - Lifestyles:

#### Scope

The scope plane defines requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane. So, accordingly , the identified required features are broken into the following categories:

- Content Requirements:
  - ## The user will be looking for:
    -
    - ...
- Functionality Requirements:
  - ## The user will be able to:
    - ...

#### Structure

The above mentioned information were organized in a site map, showing how users can navigate through the site with ease and efficiency:

</details>

#### Skeleton and Wireframes

For this project, we used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) in the initial design phase, before the coding process. This enabled us to develop the website's structure, skeleton, layout and overall look and style. We created designs for desktop, tablet and mobile screens to ensure that responsiveness was at the forefront of the application from the beginning.

To that colour scheme, there was added Medium Turquoise colour (#38D2D2) for the buttons with 3d effect from the website [Beautiful CSS buttons examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples).
The same colour was used for the gradient effect on the navbar, with the help of [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) web app.

#### Typography

Fonts used on the website are from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), namely **Carter One** and **Oxygen**. Carter One appears in the Logo, whilst Oxygen in the rest of the website.
